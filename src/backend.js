// instead of inferring it from `process.version`.
//
// It reports; it does not switch. There is deliberately no way to force a
// backend from here: the two produce identical wire bytes, and a runtime flag
// that changed which one signed would be a flag that changes what a customer's

// change which backend runs. It refuses to let the process continue on the
// wrong one, which is a different thing, and the thing a deployment under a
// validated-module control actually needs.
