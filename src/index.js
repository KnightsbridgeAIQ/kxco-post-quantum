// @kxco/post-quantum
//
// Production-tested post-quantum cryptography patterns: deterministic key
// derivation, hybrid HMAC + ML-DSA webhook signing, kid fingerprinting.
// Built on @noble/post-quantum. Used in production at KXCO across
// KnightsVault, KXCO Bank, KnightsBot, The Exchequer, and Armature L1.
//
// This package does NOT reimplement the NIST primitives. It wraps the
// @noble/post-quantum reference implementation with the integration patterns we
// have proven in production, and on Node 24+ it prefers the OpenSSL 3.5 backend.
//
// The primitives are evidenced here rather than taken on trust: every parameter
// set is checked against NIST's own ACVP vectors and cross-checked against
// liboqs, Bouncy Castle and dilithium-py/kyber-py in both directions. See
// CONFORMANCE.md, and audit/ for the dependency review.

// verifiable offline for as long as the holder keeps the public key.
