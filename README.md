ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) and SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s (FIPS 205) signatures, ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 203) key encapsulation, and key fingerprinting utilities. Category 5 sets ML-DSA-87 and ML-KEM-1024 are also available. All other `kxco-pq-*` packages depend on this one.

**On Node 24 and later the primitives run in OpenSSL 3.5**, not in JavaScript. Older Node and browsers use [`@noble/post-quantum`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-post-quantum). The two are interchangeable on the wire, which is checked rather than assumed: the interoperability matrix runs in full against both, and every report records which one produced it.

**For an independent assessor.** Every claim below is checkable without asking
us, and the machine-readable bundle behind them is a permanent unauthenticated
URL, not an expiring CI artifact:

```bash
# the full evidence bundle for the current release
curl -sLO https://github.com/KnightsbridgeAIQ/kxco-post-quantum/releases/latest/download/evidence-node24.x.zip

# or just the manifest: every file digest, and which backend produced the results
curl -sL  https://github.com/KnightsbridgeAIQ/kxco-post-quantum/releases/latest/download/manifest-node24.x.json

# licence and provenance, straight from the registry
npm view kxco-post-quantum license          # Apache-2.0
npm audit signatures --json                 # assert invalid:0 and missing:0
```

Facts that are commonly recorded wrong for this package, with the one-line
check for each: the licence is **Apache-2.0**, not commercial; the SLH-DSA
parameter set is **SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s**, a real FIPS 205 name, not
`SLH-DSA-128s`; ML-DSA-65 and ML-KEM-768 are **NIST Category 3**, and
ML-DSA-87 and ML-KEM-1024, also shipped, are Category 5; the implementation
languages are **JavaScript and C** (OpenSSL 3.5 on Node 24+).

**Evidence, not adjectives:**

- [CONFORMANCE.md](./CONFORMANCE.md): NIST ACVP vectors for FIPS 203/204/205: **2,103 vectors, 1,793 passed, 0 failed, 310 skipped**, where every skip is this library refusing a pre-hash weaker than the parameter set and is listed individually with its reason. CONFORMANCE.md says a skip is not a pass, so the headline says so too. Of those, **1,551 are in the downloadable evidence bundle**, measured from the published v1.6.3 assets: 855 in `02-conformance-acvp.json`, 624 in `02b-conformance-acvp-fips205.json` and a 72-vector sample of SLH-DSA signature generation in `02d-conformance-acvp-fips205-siggen.json`. Signature generation is sampled rather than shipped whole because it signs in seconds per operation; the full set is reproduced on demand with `node conformance/run-acvp.mjs --set SLH-DSA-sigGen-FIPS205`. The bundle names that gap rather than leaving it to be noticed. Plus a cross-implementation interop matrix against liboqs, Bouncy Castle and two pure-Python implementations (225 checks, 0 failed, both directions, with negative controls), run against both backends. Reproducible: `npm run conformance:acvp`, `npm run conformance:interop`.
- [BENCHMARKS.md](./BENCHMARKS.md): per-algorithm latency at p95/p99 on both backends and on x86-64 and arm64, plus memory. Two figures worth designing around: ML-DSA signing keeps a rejection-sampling tail on either backend (5.1x median-to-p99 in JavaScript, 3.5x on OpenSSL), and SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s signs in seconds rather than milliseconds (4.3 s and 1.7 s).
- [THREAT-MODEL.md](./THREAT-MODEL.md): what this defends against and what it does not. Read the side-channel section before deciding where a signing key lives.
- [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md): moving an RSA or ECDSA system across, and moving between versions of this package.
- [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md): reporting, release integrity, and the dependency policy.
- [AGILITY.md](./AGILITY.md): what has to change when the algorithm changes. The replacement plan, the mechanisms that exist today, the transition peers can follow, and the four kinds of agility this package does not give you.
- [BOUNDARY.md](./BOUNDARY.md): which cryptography this package performs, which it depends on, and which it merely offers to a caller. Release signing is ML-DSA-65; the transport that delivers the release is classical TLS, and that is stated rather than folded into the claim.
- [LIFECYCLE.md](./LIFECYCLE.md): supported versions, the runtime ceiling, and the one blocking supplier dependency with its mitigations. Read the roadmap beside a maturity claim, not after it.
- **Every release is reproducible and attested.** The published tarball rebuilds bit-for-bit from its own tag, verified in CI on every run, and each release carries a SLSA provenance attestation plus a CycloneDX SBOM at a permanent unauthenticated URL. A provenance attestation says a build happened in CI; the reproducible build says the artefact is the source. They are different claims and both are checkable without asking us for anything.

## Install

```bash
npm install kxco-post-quantum
```

Requires Node.js 20.19+. ESM-only.

---

## Quick start

```js
import { mlDsa, mlKem, slhDsa, fingerprint, kidEquals } from 'kxco-post-quantum'

// ML-DSA-65 — sign and verify
const { publicKey, secretKey } = mlDsa.keypairFromMaster(masterSecret, 'signing-v1')
const sig = mlDsa.sign(secretKey, 'hello')
const ok  = mlDsa.verify(publicKey, 'hello', sig)  // true

// SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s — hash-based signatures (same API shape as mlDsa)
const slh = slhDsa.keypairFromMaster(masterSecret, 'signing-v1')
const slhSig = slhDsa.sign(slh.secretKey, 'hello')
const slhOk  = slhDsa.verify(slh.publicKey, 'hello', slhSig)  // true

// Key fingerprint
const kid = fingerprint(publicKey)  // e.g. '4a7c9e2f1b3d5680'
kidEquals(kid, kid)                 // true (constant-time)

// ML-KEM-768 — key encapsulation
const kemKeys = mlKem.keypairFromMaster(masterSecret, 'encryption-v1')
const { ciphertext, sharedSecret } = mlKem.encapsulate(kemKeys.publicKey)
const recovered = mlKem.decapsulate(ciphertext, kemKeys.secretKey)
// sharedSecret and recovered are the same 32 bytes
```

`masterSecret` is a `Buffer` or `Uint8Array` with at least 16 bytes of entropy (typically 32–64 bytes from an env var or KMS).

### Category 5 parameter sets

`mlDsa87` (ML-DSA-87) and `mlKem1024` (ML-KEM-1024) have the same API as `mlDsa`
and `mlKem`, one security category higher. Reach for them when a counterparty
specifies Category 5 or names the parameter set. The KXCO default stays
Category 3.

```js
import { mlDsa87, mlKem1024 } from 'kxco-post-quantum'

const { publicKey, secretKey } = mlDsa87.keypairFromMaster(masterSecret, 'signing-v1')
const sig = mlDsa87.sign(secretKey, 'hello')      // 4627 bytes, 9254 hex chars
mlDsa87.verify(publicKey, 'hello', sig)           // true
```

| | Category 3 (default) | Category 5 |
|---|---|---|
| Signatures | `mlDsa` — pk 1952, sig 3309 | `mlDsa87` — pk 2592, sig 4627 |
| Key encapsulation | `mlKem` — pk 1184, ct 1088 | `mlKem1024` — pk 1568, ct 1568 |

The two sets do not mix, deliberately. Default derivation info differs, so one
master yields unrelated keys for each; and a signature from one set does not
verify under the other. Sizes are the migration cost, so check any fixed-width
signature or key field before mixing sets in one system.

**CNSA 2.0 names ML-DSA-87 and ML-KEM-1024, and supporting them is not a CNSA
2.0 compliance claim.** Compliance is a property of a deployment, not of an
available function. See [CONFORMANCE.md](./CONFORMANCE.md).

### Context strings (FIPS 204 / FIPS 205)

`sign` and `verify` take an optional context string, at most 255 bytes. A
signature made under a context does not verify without it, or under a different
one.

```js
const sig = mlDsa.sign(secretKey, 'hello', { context: 'kxco-nexus-v1' })

mlDsa.verify(publicKey, 'hello', sig, { context: 'kxco-nexus-v1' })  // true
mlDsa.verify(publicKey, 'hello', sig)                                // false
mlDsa.verify(publicKey, 'hello', sig, { context: 'other-v1' })       // false
```

The parameter is optional and defaults to no context, so every existing call
site is unaffected. An empty context is identical to omitting it. `slhDsa` takes
the same option.

**Context separates at the signature level; `keypairFromMaster(master, info)`
separates at the key level.** They are complementary. Use a context when one key
legitimately signs for several purposes and you need a signature from one
purpose to be unusable in another. Use a distinct derived key when the purposes
should not share a key at all.

Strings are encoded as UTF-8, so the 255-byte limit is bytes and not
characters. Over-length or wrongly typed input throws (`RangeError` /
`TypeError`) rather than returning `false`, because that is a caller bug and not
a failed verification:

```js
mlDsa.sign(secretKey, 'hello', 'kxco-nexus-v1')  // throws TypeError
                                                 // (needs { context: ... })
```

That last case is worth guarding: without the throw it would silently sign with
*no* context and produce a valid-looking signature carrying none of the intended
separation.

## API

### `mlDsa` — ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204)

| Export | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `keypairFromMaster` | `(master, info?) → { publicKey, secretKey, seed }` | Deterministic keypair via HKDF-SHA-512. `info` defaults to `'ml-dsa-65-v1'`. `seed` is the 32 bytes the pair was expanded from — see [`seed`](#seed--seed-form-keys-rfc-9964-lamps). |
| `sign` | `(secretKey, message) → string` | Signs a message. Returns a hex-encoded signature (6618 chars). |
| `verify` | `(publicKey, message, sigHex) → boolean` | Verifies a hex-encoded signature. Returns `false` on any failure. |
| `ml_dsa65` | raw primitive | The underlying `@noble/post-quantum` primitive, re-exported. |

`publicKey` is 1952 bytes. `secretKey` is 4032 bytes. `message` accepts `Buffer`, `Uint8Array`, or `string`.

### `slhDsa` — SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s (NIST FIPS 205)

Hash-based, stateless signatures. Security Category 3 (matching ML-DSA-65), but security rests only on the SHA-2 hash function — no lattice or number-theoretic assumptions. Use this as a conservative hedge alongside `mlDsa`. Tradeoff: signatures are ~5× larger (16224 vs 3309 bytes) and signing is slower.

| Export | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `keypairFromMaster` | `(master, info?) → { publicKey, secretKey }` | Deterministic keypair via HKDF-SHA-512. `info` defaults to `'slh-dsa-sha2-192s-v1'`. |
| `sign` | `(secretKey, message) → string` | Signs a message. Returns a hex-encoded signature (32448 chars). |
| `verify` | `(publicKey, message, sigHex) → boolean` | Verifies a hex-encoded signature. Returns `false` on any failure. |
| `slh_dsa_sha2_192s` | raw primitive | The underlying `@noble/post-quantum` primitive, re-exported. |

`publicKey` is 48 bytes. `secretKey` is 96 bytes. `message` accepts `Buffer`, `Uint8Array`, or `string`.

### `mlKem` — ML-KEM-768 (NIST FIPS 203)

| Export | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `keypairFromMaster` | `(master, info?) → { publicKey, secretKey, seed }` | Deterministic keypair via HKDF-SHA-512. `info` defaults to `'ml-kem-768-v1'`. `seed` is the 64 bytes the pair was expanded from. |
| `encapsulate` | `(publicKey) → { ciphertext, sharedSecret }` | Generates a shared secret and ciphertext to send to the key holder. |
| `decapsulate` | `(ciphertext, secretKey) → Buffer` | Recovers the shared secret from a ciphertext. Returns 32 bytes. |
| `ml_kem768` | raw primitive | The underlying `@noble/post-quantum` primitive, re-exported. |

`publicKey` is 1184 bytes. `ciphertext` is 1088 bytes. `sharedSecret` is 32 bytes.

### `fingerprint(publicKey)` → `string`

First 16 hex characters of SHA-256 of the public key. Stable for the lifetime of the key. Accepts raw bytes or a hex string.

### `kidEquals(a, b)` → `boolean`

Constant-time comparison of two kid strings. Use this when comparing user-supplied input — not `===`.

### `deriveSeed(master, info, length)` → `Buffer`

HKDF-SHA-512 derivation. `master` must be at least 16 bytes. `info` is a required domain-separation string. Returns `length` bytes.

### `seed` — seed-form keys (RFC 9964, LAMPS)

FIPS 203 and 204 expand a keypair from a short seed. The expanded private key
this package returns is derived from that seed and does not contain it, so a
seed cannot be recovered from an expanded key. `keypairFromMaster` therefore
returns the seed it derived alongside the pair — additive, so callers that
destructure `{ publicKey, secretKey }` are unaffected.

Seed form is 32 bytes for ML-DSA and 64 for ML-KEM. It fits in a KMS secret, an
HSM object or an env var, and it is the only private form an RFC 9964 AKP JWK
accepts.

| Export | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SEED_ALGORITHMS` | `string[]` | `ML-DSA-65`, `ML-DSA-87`, `ML-KEM-768`, `ML-KEM-1024`. SLH-DSA has no seed form. |
| `seedFromMaster` | `(alg, master, info?) → bytes` | Same HKDF-SHA-512 derivation `keypairFromMaster` uses, so it reproduces keys already in production. |
| `keypairFromSeed` | `(alg, seed) → { publicKey, secretKey, seed }` | Expands a seed. Byte-identical to what OpenSSL 3.5 derives from the same seed. |
| `exportJwk` | `(alg, { publicKey, seed? }, opts?) → jwk` | RFC 9964 AKP JWK. `priv` carries the seed. |
| `importJwk` | `(jwk) → { alg, publicKey, secretKey?, seed? }` | Rejects a JWK whose seed and `pub` disagree. |
| `exportSeedPkcs8` | `(alg, seed) → bytes` | PKCS#8 in LAMPS seed form, the `[0] IMPLICIT` CHOICE. |
| `importSeedPkcs8` | `(der) → { alg, seed }` | Refuses an expanded-form key rather than truncating it into a seed. |

The encodings are not read off the specification. `test/seed.test.js` asserts
that the DER this package writes is byte-identical to what this machine's
OpenSSL writes, for every parameter set, and skips with a reason where there is
no native backend to compare against.

```js
import { mlDsa, seed } from 'kxco-post-quantum'

const key = mlDsa.keypairFromMaster(process.env.KXCO_MASTER_KEY)
const jwk = seed.exportJwk('ML-DSA-65', key, { kid: fingerprint(key.publicKey) })
// { kty: 'AKP', alg: 'ML-DSA-65', pub: '...', priv: '<32-byte seed>', kid: '...' }
```

### `jws` — compact JWS with the RFC 9964 algorithm names

Format only. A token signed here verifies in any process holding the public
key, offline, with no configuration and no licence. RFC 9964 registered
`ML-DSA-65` and `ML-DSA-87` as JWS algorithms so a post-quantum signature can
travel the path an institution's gateway, IdP and partner verifier already
parse.

| Export | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `signJws` | `(payload, secretKey, opts?) → string` | Compact JWS. Objects are JSON-serialised. `opts.alg` defaults to `ML-DSA-65`. |
| `verifyJws` | `(token, publicKey, opts?) → { valid, ... }` | Fails closed. `{ alg }` and `{ kid }` pin what the header may declare. |
| `decodeJwsHeader` | `(token) → object \| null` | Unauthenticated read, for choosing which key to fetch. |

The algorithm is resolved from an allowlist inside the module, never from the
token, so a token cannot name its own verification routine. `crit` and `b64`
headers are refused rather than ignored, and the public key's length must match
the algorithm the header declares.

There is no SLH-DSA option here: FIPS 205 signing takes on the order of a
second and a half, which does not belong on a request path.

### `backend()` and `isNative(alg)`

Reports which implementation is doing the maths in this process — `openssl`
with its version and parameter sets, or `javascript` with the reason the native
backend is unavailable. For evidence bundles and support tickets. It reports;
there is deliberately no way to switch backend from here.

### `webhook` — hybrid HMAC + ML-DSA-65 delivery signing

Low-level helpers for the KXCO hybrid webhook pattern: `envelope`, `hmacHex`, `verifyHmac`, `pqSign`, `verifyPq`, `signDelivery`, `verifyDelivery`. HMAC-SHA-256 gives symmetric verification with no library dependency; ML-DSA-65 adds non-repudiation over the same `${timestamp}.${body}` envelope. The full identity/credential surface lives in `kxco-pq-sdk`.

---

## Requiring the native backend

This package picks its implementation at import time: OpenSSL 3.5 where the
runtime provides the FIPS 203/204/205 primitives, the JavaScript implementation
otherwise. Both produce identical wire bytes, so falling back is the right
default and nothing about a signature changes.

It is the wrong default in one situation: a deployment under a control that says
cryptography must execute inside a validated module. There, a silent fallback
means the control is not in force and nothing says so.

```js
import { requireNativeBackend } from 'kxco-post-quantum'

requireNativeBackend(['ML-DSA-65', 'ML-KEM-768'])
```

It throws `ERR_KXCO_PQ_BACKEND` if the JavaScript backend is live, or if the
OpenSSL present cannot provide a parameter set you named. The error carries
`actual`, `missing` and `available` so a failure says which, rather than only
that.

Operators can enforce it without touching application code, which matters
because the team under the control is usually not the team calling the library:

```
KXCO_PQ_REQUIRE_NATIVE=1
```

Set that and a process which has landed on the JavaScript backend fails at
import, before its first signature rather than after.

**What this does and does not claim.** It asserts that OpenSSL is doing the
maths. Whether that OpenSSL is a FIPS-validated module is a property of your
build, not of this package, and no library can see it from the inside. What it
removes is the silent fallback, which is the part this package is responsible
for. It is an assertion, never a switch: it cannot change which backend runs,
because a flag that changed which implementation signed would change what your
evidence means.

## Where this fits

This is the primitive layer, and it stays that: keys, signatures, encapsulation
and fingerprints, with nothing else in the way. Everything above it builds here.

- [`kxco-pq-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kxco-pq-sdk) for identity credentials and verifiable claims
- [`kxco-pq-chain`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kxco-pq-chain) to put a signature on Armature L1, where the chain verifies it in consensus
- [`kxco-pq-hsm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kxco-pq-hsm) to hold the key in hardware

## Part of the KXCO stack

`kxco-post-quantum` is the primitive layer. Everything else builds on it:

- **`kxco-pq-sdk`** — identity credentials, webhook signing, verifiable claims
- Other `kxco-pq-*` packages — domain-specific integrations

Install this package directly when you need ML-DSA or ML-KEM without the rest of the identity stack.

## Security

Cryptographic operations delegate entirely to [`@noble/post-quantum`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-post-quantum) and [`@noble/hashes`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes) — this package does not reimplement any NIST primitive. `@noble/hashes` falls under Cure53's 2023 audit of the `@noble` ecosystem (`ciphers`, `curves`, `hashes`); `@noble/post-quantum` was **not** in that audit's scope and has been self-audited by its maintainer. See [AUDIT.md](./AUDIT.md) for the full posture.

## Verifying a release

Every release asset is signed with ML-DSA-65 by this package's own signing path,
and carries a SLSA provenance file recording the workflow that built it.

```
manifest-node24.x.json          the bundle's manifest
evidence-node24.x.zip           the bundle
evidence-node24.x.zip.sig       ML-DSA-65 signature over the zip, hex
evidence.intoto.jsonl           SLSA provenance
release-signing-key.pub.hex     the public key, also committed to this repository
```

```js
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import { mlDsa } from 'kxco-post-quantum'

const pub = Buffer.from(readFileSync('release-signing-key.pub.hex', 'utf8').trim(), 'hex')
const sig = readFileSync('evidence-node24.x.zip.sig', 'utf8').trim()
mlDsa.verify(pub, readFileSync('evidence-node24.x.zip'), sig)   // true
```

Compare the public key against the copy in this repository before trusting a
signature: a key served alongside the artefact it signs proves only that the
same party produced both.
