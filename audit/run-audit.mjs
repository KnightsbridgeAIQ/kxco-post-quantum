// Dependency audit: every production dependency, reviewed and then re-checked.
//
// `npm audit` answers one question, which is whether anything in the tree has a
// published advisory. That is worth knowing and it is not an audit. It says
// nothing about why a package is present, what is actually called from it,
// whether anyone has ever reviewed its source, whether the version is pinned or
// floating, or whether it can run code at install time.
//
// audit/dependency-review.json holds the answers to those, written by a person.
// This file re-derives every mechanical fact from the lockfile, the registry and
// the installed tree, and fails if any of them has moved away from what the
// review records. A new or bumped dependency therefore breaks the build until
// somebody reviews it, which is the only way a document like this stays true.
//

// answer is the union of the Node and browser paths. That is the safe direction

// also matches inside comments and strings, and it did: src/seed.js throws
// `the public key derived from 'priv' does not match 'pub'`, so the scanner

// FAIL in the dependency job is worse than no job, because it teaches everyone
