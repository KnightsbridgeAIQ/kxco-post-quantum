# Changelog

## 1.7.2

Documentation, and one typing fix. No source change to the library and no wire
format change.

**Three documents the package needed and did not have.** Buyer readiness
assessments ask what the product boundary is, what cryptographic agility it
actually has, and what constrains its lifecycle. All three had real answers in
the code and the evidence. None was written down, and an answer that exists
only in a maintainer's head is not evidence.

BOUNDARY.md separates what this package performs from what it depends on and
what it merely offers a caller. Nothing in src/ opens a socket, so the
operating path has no classical service dependency at all. Release signing is
ML-DSA-65 with the key committed here; the transport that delivers the release
is classical TLS, and that is stated rather than folded into the claim.

AGILITY.md separates the three things the term is used for: a replacement plan,
an implemented mechanism, and an interoperable transition. It also names the
four kinds of agility this package does not give you, including that a
parameter set outside the published five needs a release rather than a
configuration change.

LIFECYCLE.md carries supported versions, the runtime ceiling, and the blocking
supplier dependency with its mitigations ranked. The end-of-support window is
marked not yet decided rather than invented.

All three are copied into the evidence bundle. An assessor reads the bundle,
not the repository.

**requireNativeBackend is now in the typings.** 1.7.0 shipped it, and shipped
it exported from index.js and documented in the README while declared in
neither backend.d.ts nor index.d.ts. A TypeScript caller therefore could not
reach the one control in this package that enforces a no-fallback policy, which
is precisely the deployment the feature exists for. Runtime behaviour was
always correct; the type surface hid it.

## 1.7.1

Release integrity. No source change to the library.

Release assets are now signed with ML-DSA-65 through this package's own signing
path, and each release carries a SLSA provenance file. Until now the npm tarball
had provenance and the GitHub release, where the evidence bundle is actually
downloaded from, had neither a signature nor a statement of where it was built.

The public key is committed as release-signing-key.pub.hex and published with
each release. The signing script refuses to run if the seed in CI stops deriving
that key, and verifies every signature immediately after producing it.

## 1.7.0

Additive. No existing export changes shape, no wire format moves, and the
default behaviour of the package is unchanged.

**`requireNativeBackend([algorithms])`.** The package picks OpenSSL where the
runtime has the FIPS 203/204/205 primitives and the JavaScript implementation
otherwise. Both produce identical bytes, so the fallback is right nearly always.
It is wrong under a control that says cryptography must execute inside a
validated module: there the fallback means the control is not in force and
nothing says so. This throws `ERR_KXCO_PQ_BACKEND` instead, carrying `actual`,
`missing` and `available` so the failure says which requirement was not met.

**`KXCO_PQ_REQUIRE_NATIVE=1`.** The same requirement from the environment,
because the team under the control is usually not the team calling the library.
A process that has landed on the JavaScript backend then fails at import rather
than at its first signature.

It asserts, it does not switch. There is still no way to force a backend, for
the reason there never was: a flag that changed which implementation signed
would change what a customer's evidence means. This only refuses to continue on
the wrong one.

It also claims only what it can see. Whether the OpenSSL underneath is a
FIPS-validated module is a property of the operator's build; no library can
determine that from the inside, and this does not pretend to. It removes the
silent fallback, which is the part this package owns.

Tested on both backends without mocking: CI runs Node 20 and 22, which have no
native primitives and exercise the refusal, and Node 24, which exercises the
accept path.

## 1.6.4

Documentation. The npm description said "2,103 NIST ACVP vectors and 225
interop checks, 0 failed", which reads as 2,103 passing. The evidence records
2,103 tested, 1,793 passed, 0 failed, 310 skipped, and CONFORMANCE.md says a
skip is not a pass.

Twelve sibling READMEs were corrected for this yesterday and this package's own
README has been right for months. The description was the one place it
survived, and a description only changes when the package is published, so it
needed a release rather than a commit. It is the first thing anyone reads.

Also corrects the count of what the downloadable bundle contains, from 1,479
to the 1,551 actually present in the published v1.6.3 assets.

## 1.6.3

Release plumbing only. No source change.

1.6.2 shipped without its evidence bundle, because the upload step was gated on
a `release` event that cannot occur: publish.yml creates the release with the
default GITHUB_TOKEN, and GitHub raises no workflow events for actions taken
with that token. The bundle attached by hand afterwards came from a
push-triggered build, so it carried 855 subsampled vectors while the README
states that 1,479 are in the downloadable bundle. Correctly labelled in the
manifest, but not what the README describes.

This release exists so a tag produces the bundle the README promises: the
workflow now runs on `v*` tags, treats a tag as a full build rather than a
subsampled one, and uploads without a human in the loop.

## 1.6.2

No change to the cryptography, the exports or the wire format. This release
exists because the evidence describing them was wrong.

**The interoperability report contradicted itself.** Every check wrote its
failure sentence unconditionally while `ok` was computed separately, so a
passing tamper control published `{"ok": true, "detail": "peer accepted a
tampered signature"}`, and a passing byte-equality check published
"deterministic signatures differ" followed by two identical values. 150 passing
checks in the last bundle carried text that reads as a security failure. Every
check now takes its sentence from its outcome.

**The evidence bundle could not be built in CI, and never had been.** The
workflow ran `npm ci` and nothing else: no ACVP vector fetch, no Java, no
pinned Python peers, no liboqs image. Eight runs, both runtimes, all failed at
the same step, so the only bundle an assessor could reach was hand-built from
an uncommitted working tree. The workflow now does the setup its sibling always
did, and the build starts from an empty directory rather than inheriting files
from the run before it.

**OpenSSL changed its default ML-DSA private key encoding in a patch release.**
3.5.6 writes the 54-byte seed form, 3.5.7 the 4098-byte expanded form. FIPS 204
allows either and this package still writes the seed form, which 3.5.7 continues
to accept. The conformance test compared our bytes against whatever OpenSSL
preferred, so it began failing on a change that was not ours. It now holds the
byte-identity claim where OpenSSL writes seeds, and asserts that OpenSSL parses
our seed form to the same seed and public key where it does not.

**The dependency audit failed on its own regex**, matching an import specifier
inside a string in an error message and reporting an unresolvable module named
`priv`. Same 39 files from 12 entry points, same verdicts, no false failure.

## 1.6.0

Additive. No existing export changes shape in a way a caller can observe, no
wire format moves, and the pinned vectors still match bit-for-bit.

**Seed-form keys.** FIPS 203 and 204 expand a keypair from a short seed, and
the expanded private key does not contain the seed it came from. So seed export
had to start at derivation: `keypairFromMaster` now also returns the seed it
already derived. Callers destructuring `{ publicKey, secretKey }` see no
difference. `seed.seedFromMaster` reproduces exactly the same bytes, which is
what makes seed export possible for keys already in production.

New `seed` namespace: `keypairFromSeed`, `seedFromMaster`, `exportJwk`,
`importJwk`, `exportSeedPkcs8`, `importSeedPkcs8`, for ML-DSA-65, ML-DSA-87,
ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024. JWKs are RFC 9964 `kty: "AKP"`, where `priv` is the
seed; PKCS#8 is the LAMPS seed form, the `[0] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING` CHOICE.
Both load directly into OpenSSL 3.5 and Node 24+. The existing expanded-key
export is untouched and old keys verify unchanged.

None of that is read off the specification. `test/seed.test.js` asserts the DER
this package writes is byte-identical to what OpenSSL writes, for every
parameter set, and that a seed expands to the same public key under both
backends. Where there is no native backend those tests skip with a reason
rather than passing quietly, because a green suite on a runtime without OpenSSL
is not evidence about OpenSSL.

An expanded secret key is refused where a seed belongs, and an expanded-form
PKCS#8 key is refused rather than truncated. Both would otherwise silently
produce a different keypair: the first 32 bytes of an expanded ML-DSA key are
not its seed.

**Compact JWS.** New `jws` namespace: `signJws`, `verifyJws`,
`decodeJwsHeader`, using the RFC 9964 algorithm names `ML-DSA-65` and
`ML-DSA-87`. Format only — no network, no configuration, no licence, and a
token stays verifiable offline for as long as the holder keeps the public key.
The algorithm is resolved from an allowlist inside the module rather than from
the token, so a token cannot name its own verification routine; `crit` and `b64`
are refused rather than ignored; and the key length must match the declared
algorithm, so a mixed-up key reports itself instead of looking like a bad
signature. SLH-DSA is deliberately not offered: FIPS 205 signing takes about a
second and a half and does not belong on a request path.

**A second correction to AUDIT.md.** The v1.1.2 correction fixed a false claim
that `@noble/post-quantum` was Cure53-audited, and in doing so introduced a
different inaccuracy: it described a single "Cure53 2023 NDS-01" audit covering
`@noble/ciphers`, `@noble/curves` and `@noble/hashes`. There is no such
engagement. Those are three separate audits at three different dates, and this
repository's own `audit/dependency-review.json` — generated by
`audit/run-audit.mjs`, not written by hand — recorded them correctly the whole
time:

| Package | Audited by |
|---|---|
| `@noble/post-quantum` | maintainer-audited, v0.6.1, Apr 2026 |
| `@noble/hashes` | Cure53, Jan 2022, v1.0.0 (Ethereum Foundation with Nomic Labs) |
| `@noble/curves` | Trail of Bits Feb 2023; Kudelski Sep 2023; Cure53 Sep 2024 |
| `@noble/ciphers` | Cure53, Sep 2024, v1.0.0 (OpenSats) |

The load-bearing claim never changed and was correct throughout:
**`@noble/post-quantum` has never been audited by a third party.** What was
wrong was the supporting detail, and the wrong wording had been copied into
sibling repositories before it was caught. AUDIT.md now matches the generated
record, and the v1.1.2 changelog entry is left as it was written — a released
entry is a record of what was said at the time, not a place to rewrite it.

**An evidence bundle.** `npm run evidence` writes `dist/evidence/`: versions,
the commit, the toolchain, which backend did the maths, the ACVP and interop
conformance output, the test suite output, a CycloneDX SBOM, the registry
signature check, and copies of AUDIT.md, THREAT-MODEL.md, SECURITY.md,
CONFORMANCE.md, DEPENDENCIES.md and LICENCE-PRODUCT.md.

**It is not an audit and it says so three times** — in the manifest's
`disclaimer` field, in the bundle README, and in the copied AUDIT.md. A CI step
asserts both disclaimers are still present, because the one sentence that must
never be edited out of an evidence bundle is the one saying it is not an audit.

A step that fails is recorded as a failure in the manifest rather than aborting
the build: a bundle missing a section with no explanation is worse than one
that says what did not run and why. Optional steps (peers needing a JVM, a
registry check needing a token) do not fail the build; required ones do.

The `evidence` workflow runs on Node 22 and 24 — the first has no OpenSSL 3.5
FIPS primitives and so exercises the JavaScript backend, the second exercises
OpenSSL. Shipping only one bundle would let a reader draw a conclusion about
code that never ran. Push builds subsample and record that they did; scheduled
and release builds do a full pass.

New `LICENCE-PRODUCT.md` states what is free (the maths, permanently, and
chain-agnostic) and what is paid (the hosted registry, the relay, anchoring,
live revocation, SLA), that the `KXCO Verified` mark needs a contract, and that
no third party has assessed this code and a customer may re-run the published
vectors without asking.

**`backend()` and `isNative(alg)`.** The package chooses its backend by probing
the runtime, so the only honest way to state which one a deployment used is to
ask it. These report; neither switches. The ACVP conformance report now records
`backendUnderTest` explicitly, saying that it drives the JavaScript primitives
directly and that the OpenSSL backend is evidenced by the interop matrix
instead. The same pass count previously described either implementation.

## 1.5.3

Documentation and metadata. No code change.

Corrects stale performance figures. The README and BENCHMARKS.md both quoted a
4.5x median-to-p99 tail for ML-DSA signing and about 6.8 seconds for
SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s. Measured now, across both backends: the tail is 5.1x in
JavaScript and 3.5x on OpenSSL, and SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s signs in 4.3 s and 1.7 s.

Says what the package does. The README still described it as a wrapper around
@noble/post-quantum without mentioning that on Node 24 and later the primitives
run in OpenSSL 3.5. The npm description, which is what appears in registry search
results, listed the algorithms and nothing else: not the 2,103 NIST ACVP vectors,
not the 225-check interoperability matrix, not the reproducible build or the
provenance attestation. Those are the parts that distinguish this from any other
post-quantum wrapper, and they were absent from the one line most readers see.

A dependabot ignore blocks @noble/post-quantum 0.7.1 specifically, so it is not
reproposed weekly. The ACVP job fails the build on it regardless; this stops the
pull request being opened. 0.7.2 and later will still be offered and should be
accepted once the vectors pass.

## 1.5.2

**Reverts `@noble/post-quantum` to 0.7.0. Upgrade from 1.5.1 immediately if you
verify SLH-DSA signatures.**

1.5.1 bumped the backend to 0.7.1. That version **fails nine NIST ACVP SLH-DSA
verification vectors that 0.7.0 passes**, returning `false` where the vectors
require `true`. In practice that means a valid SLH-DSA signature can be
rejected. It is a correctness and availability fault, not a security weakening:
nothing invalid is accepted. No other algorithm family is affected, and ML-DSA
and ML-KEM pass unchanged on both versions.

The failures are confined to the **internal** signature interface
(`SLH-DSA.Verify_internal`), not the pre-hash interface, and appear across both
SHA2 and SHAKE parameter sets: SHA2-128s, SHA2-192f, SHA2-256f, SHA2-256s,
SHAKE-128f, SHAKE-128s, SHAKE-256f, SHAKE-256s. Reproduce with:

```
npm run conformance:fetch
node conformance/run-acvp.mjs --set SLH-DSA-sigVer-FIPS205 --max-per-group 3
```

0.7.0 returns 87 passed, 0 failed, 21 skipped. 0.7.1 returns 78 passed, 9
failed.

This has been reported upstream. Until it is resolved the pin stays at 0.7.0,
and the ACVP job will fail the build on any attempt to move it, which is the
behaviour we want.

**Why this is worth saying plainly rather than quietly reverting.** The
conformance evidence in this repository is not decoration. It caught a real
regression in a dependency within hours of that dependency's release, on a
version bump whose own release notes described only hardening. A test suite that
passes is not evidence; a test suite that fails when something breaks is. Ours
did.

1.5.1 is deprecated on npm.

## 1.5.1

Dependency bump: `@noble/post-quantum` 0.7.0 to **0.7.1**, published 2026-08-27.
Exact pin as always, never a range.

Worth taking rather than waiting for the scheduled Dependabot run, because one of
its changes touches how this package calls it: 0.7.1 snapshots options on entry
so a caller's object cannot be mutated afterwards. Every FIPS 204 context string
this package passes goes in as an options object, so that hardening is directly
on our path.

It also adds a WebCrypto wrapper for ML-KEM upstream. Nothing here uses it yet,
but it is worth knowing that the backend is converging on the same thing this
package did in 1.5.0: use the platform's implementation where the platform has
one.

Verified before merging, on all three runtimes: 39 pinned vectors bit-for-bit and
53 tests on Node 20 and 22 (the JavaScript path, where this bump actually
applies) and on Node 24+ (the OpenSSL path).

AUDIT.md carries the new pin and its integrity hash. The conservative bound is
unchanged and restated: the maintainer's self-audit covers 0.6.1, we ship 0.7.1,
so **the version we ship is covered by no audit at all**.

## 1.5.0

**The FIPS primitives now run in OpenSSL where the runtime has them.** On Node 24
and later this package uses OpenSSL 3.5 for ML-KEM, ML-DSA and SLH-DSA. On Node
20 and 22, in browsers, and on any runtime without them, the JavaScript backend
is used exactly as before.

Additive. No export changed, no signature changed, no key format changed, and
`@noble/post-quantum` is still a dependency and still the backend on every
runtime that lacks the native primitives. Nothing is removed.

**Both backends are checked against each other rather than assumed to agree.**
The interoperability matrix runs in full on both, against liboqs, Bouncy Castle
and dilithium-py / kyber-py, and both return **225 passed, 0 failed, 42 not
applicable across 38 rows**. CI runs both legs. Every generated report now
records which backend produced it under `wrapperBackend`, because a run that
does not say is not evidence about either one.

Keys and signatures are unchanged on the wire, which is what makes this safe to
do silently: a signature made by one backend verifies under the other, in both
directions, for all nine parameter sets. Existing keys keep working. Nothing
needs migrating.

Measured on the development machine:

| | OpenSSL | JavaScript | |
|---|---|---|---|
| ML-DSA-65 sign | 1.34 ms | 11.54 ms | 8.6x |
| ML-DSA-65 verify | 0.28 ms | 2.22 ms | 7.9x |
| SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s sign | 1595 ms | 4717 ms | 3.0x |

**A FIPS 204 context string keeps the JavaScript path.** Node's `sign` and
`verify` take no context argument, and signing without the caller's context
would produce a signature that verifies against nothing. That is a deliberate
fallback, not a gap.

**THREAT-MODEL.md is updated, and the change is narrower than it looks.** That
document argued the timing and cache attacker was out of scope *structurally*,
because the property cannot be established from inside JavaScript. On the
OpenSSL path that argument no longer applies. It does not follow that this
package is constant-time: we have published no timing measurements, and
OpenSSL's side-channel posture is theirs to state rather than ours to assert.
The honest position is that the attacker moves from structurally out of scope to
**unmeasured** on Node 24+, and stays out of scope everywhere else.

## 1.4.1

Evidence and documentation only. **No `src/` module changed**, no export was
added or removed, and the dependency set is unchanged, so no call site can
behave differently than it did on 1.4.0.

**liboqs is now a third interop implementation.** The cross-implementation
matrix ran against two peers and now runs against three: liboqs 0.16.0 (C),
Bouncy Castle 1.85.2 (Java) and dilithium-py 1.4.0 / kyber-py 1.2.0 (Python).
**225 checks passed, 0 failed, 42 not applicable, across 38 rows**, up from
156/0/10 across 24. The previous figures are reproduced exactly when the new
peer is excluded, so nothing about the existing evidence moved.

SLH-DSA had one peer and now has two. liboqs runs from a container built from
source at a tag pinned in `peers-lock.json`, and CI builds it, so the version
tested is the version named.

A peer that cannot do something now records as not-applicable rather than as a
disagreement. The 42 not-applicable are itemised in CONFORMANCE.md: ten from our
own hedged signing, thirty-two from two liboqs API limits.

**AUDIT.md corrections.** The reviewer checklist told anyone doing due diligence
to fetch an endpoint that returns 500. Verification now goes to Armature L1 over
public JSON-RPC, with the calldata layout documented and a named article page
for the other half of the join. Both documented commands were run verbatim
against production before publishing.

Two false claims in the same file are withdrawn. It said we pin
`@noble/post-quantum@0.6.1`, "the exact version covered by the maintainer's own
self-audit"; we ship `0.7.0`, the self-audit covers `0.6.1`, and **the version we
ship is covered by no audit at all**. It also described the dependency as
"itself audited", contradicting its own section 1.

**Supply chain.** Each release now publishes its CycloneDX SBOM as a GitHub
Release asset at `releases/download/<tag>/sbom.cyclonedx.json`, a permanent
unauthenticated URL. It was previously generated but retained only as an
expiring Actions artifact, which is not a published SBOM. The dependency policy
is now stated in SECURITY.md rather than living only in `dependabot.yml`.

## 1.4.0

Adds the Security Category 5 parameter sets, and publishes conformance and
interoperability evidence for everything the package computes.

Additive throughout. Two new modules appear under `src/`, and no existing module,
export, default or call path changes: the dependency set is unchanged, the
default parameter sets stay at Category 3, and all 39 pinned vectors still match
bit-for-bit. Nothing here can alter the behaviour of an existing call site.

### Added
- **`mlDsa87` (ML-DSA-87) and `mlKem1024` (ML-KEM-1024)**, Security Category 5,
  as new modules with the same API as their Category 3 counterparts. Purely
  additive: no existing module, export or call path changes, and the KXCO
  default stays Category 3. Subpath exports `./ml-dsa-87` and `./ml-kem-1024`.
  Both are exercised by the ACVP harness and the interop matrix through their
  wrapper path, not only as primitives.

  Default derivation info differs from the Category 3 modules
  (`ml-dsa-87-v1`, `ml-kem-1024-v1`), so one master yields unrelated keys per
  parameter set rather than colliding, and `test/category5.test.js` asserts that
  a signature from one set does not verify under the other in either direction.

  **Supporting these sets is not a CNSA 2.0 compliance claim.** CNSA 2.0 names
  both, and compliance is a property of a deployment rather than of an available
  function: the KXCO estate signs at Category 3, including Armature L1 from
  block 0 and every issued KXCO ID, none of which these modules change. The
  accurate sentence is "supports ML-DSA-87 and ML-KEM-1024". This is stated in
  both module headers, both type declarations, the README, MIGRATION.md and
  CONFORMANCE.md, because it is the claim most likely to drift.

  Sizes, since they are the real migration cost: ML-DSA-87 public key 2592 and
  signature 4627 bytes, against 1952 and 3309 at ML-DSA-65. ML-KEM-1024 public
  key and ciphertext 1568 bytes each, against 1184 and 1088. The ML-KEM shared
  secret stays 32 bytes at both sets, so downstream key derivation is unaffected.
- **`conformance/`, a NIST ACVP harness** for FIPS 203, 204 and 205, covering
  every parameter set NIST publishes vectors for: ML-KEM-512/768/1024,
  ML-DSA-44/65/87 and all twelve SLH-DSA sets. The signature sets cover the
  external and internal interfaces, pure and pre-hashed, external-mu, and
  deterministic and randomized signing. Vectors are pinned by upstream commit
  and per-file SHA-256 in `conformance/acvp-lock.json`, so a rewritten upstream
  file fails the fetch instead of quietly changing the result.
- **`conformance/interop/`, a cross-implementation matrix** against Bouncy
  Castle (Java) and dilithium-py / kyber-py (Python), neither of which shares
  code with our backend. Every check runs in both directions, and includes
  negative controls: a tampered signature that the peer must reject, and a
  corrupted ML-KEM ciphertext that must decapsulate to an unrelated secret.
  Without those, a peer that always returned true would pass the whole matrix.
- **`CONFORMANCE.md`** reporting both, including what the evidence does not
  cover: no side-channel claim, no FIPS 140-3 validation, no CNSA 2.0
  assertion, no protocol-level encoding claim.
- **`THREAT-MODEL.md`** stating the security boundary. In particular it states
  plainly that constant-time execution cannot be established from inside
  JavaScript, that timing, cache and power attackers are therefore out of
  scope, and what to do instead when a key needs to withstand them.
- **`MIGRATION.md`** covering the add-then-remove path off RSA or ECDSA, and
  version-to-version upgrades.
- **`.github/workflows/conformance.yml`** running both harnesses on every push
  and in full weekly, so the reports describe current behaviour rather than the
  day someone ran them by hand. The SLH-DSA signature sets run as a separate job
  because a full pass of them takes over an hour, and per-push runs subsample
  with a per-group cap, which the generated report records so a subsampled run
  cannot be mistaken for a full one.
- **A CycloneDX SBOM generated during publish**, from the tree that was actually
  installed for the build, and attached to the release artifacts.
- Scripts: `conformance:fetch`, `conformance:acvp`, `conformance:interop`, `sbom`.

### Notes
- **The pre-hash skips in the ACVP report are the library being stricter than
  NIST's sample files, not a coverage gap.** The backend refuses a pre-hash
  whose collision strength is below the parameter set's security category;
  NIST's vectors pair every approved hash with every parameter set. Those cases
  are counted as skipped, never as passed.
- **Hedged signing means wrapper signatures are not reproducible.** `sign` draws
  fresh randomness per signature, which FIPS 204 permits and recommends, so the
  byte-equality check does not apply on the wrapper path. It is asserted on the
  backend path for the same parameter sets. This is reported rather than hidden.
- **Provenance:** a release published from a workstation instead of through
  `publish.yml` carries no npm attestation. The Trusted Publishing binding still
  names the old `JackKXCO` org after the move to `KnightsbridgeAIQ` and needs
  repointing before the OIDC path can work. See the comment in `publish.yml`.

## 1.3.0

Adds FIPS 204 / FIPS 205 context string support. Purely additive: the
cryptographic surface for every existing call site is byte-for-byte unchanged,
and all 39 pinned vectors still match.

### Added
- **Optional `context` on `mlDsa.sign` / `mlDsa.verify`** via a trailing options
  object, `{ context }`. At most 255 bytes per FIPS 204 section 5.2; strings are
  encoded as UTF-8. A signature made under a context does not verify without it
  or under a different one. Closes a real incompleteness relative to FIPS 204:
  the library previously could not verify a counterparty's signature that used a
  context.
- **The same option on `slhDsa.sign` / `slhDsa.verify`**, on the same terms.
  Added alongside ML-DSA rather than after it, because one signature module
  accepting an options object while its sibling silently ignored one would be a
  footgun.
- `MAX_CONTEXT_BYTES` (255) exported from both modules.
- `test/context.test.js`, 26 tests, including cross-verification against
  third-party ML-DSA-65 signatures produced by OpenSSL through Python
  `cryptography`, covering five context shapes: short, single-byte, the 255-byte
  maximum, binary, and multi-byte UTF-8.

### Notes
- **No behaviour change without the new argument.** Omitting `opts` takes the
  identical code path as before. An empty context is collapsed to no context,
  which is what FIPS 204 specifies and what was verified empirically.
- **Misuse throws rather than returning `false`.** A context over 255 bytes, a
  wrongly typed context, or a bare value passed where an options object belongs
  raises `RangeError` / `TypeError`. These are caller bugs, not failed
  verifications, and swallowing them would hide a signature that silently
  carried no domain separation. No existing call site passes the argument, so
  nothing can regress.
- Works identically on `@noble/post-quantum` 0.6.1 and 0.7.0, verified on both,
  so this release is independent of the 0.7.0 upgrade.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-07-22

Metadata alignment. No code changes; cryptographic surface is byte-for-byte
identical to `1.2.0` (all 39 pinned vectors match).

### Changed
- **License now `Apache-2.0`** in package metadata, matching the repository
  LICENSE. `1.2.0` was published declaring `MIT` from a pre-relicense branch;
  this release corrects the published license to the canonical `Apache-2.0`.
- `author` set to **Shayne Heffernan and John Heffernan**.
- README security note corrected: `@noble/post-quantum` was **not** in scope
  of Cure53's 2023 `@noble` audit (which covered `ciphers`/`curves`/`hashes`)
  and is maintainer self-audited — the prior "audited by Cure53 (2024)"
  wording was inaccurate. See `AUDIT.md`.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-22

Adds SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) and modernises the underlying primitive engine to
`@noble/post-quantum@0.6.1`. **No breaking changes for consumers** — the
public API and all previously pinned outputs are byte-for-byte identical.

### Added
- **`slhDsa` — SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s (NIST FIPS 205)**, exported both from the
  package root and the `kxco-post-quantum/slh-dsa` subpath. Hash-based,
  stateless signatures at Security Category 3 (matching ML-DSA-65), whose
  security rests only on SHA-2 — the conservative hedge alongside the
  lattice-based ML-DSA-65. Deterministic `keypairFromMaster(master, info?)`
  via the same HKDF-SHA-512 derivation, plus `sign` / `verify`. Public key
  48 bytes, secret key 96 bytes, signature 16224 bytes.
- Test vectors extended to pin SLH-DSA keypairs and round-trip (39 checks,
  up from 29).

### Changed
- **`@noble/post-quantum` bumped `^0.2.1` → `^0.6.1`** — the FIPS 203/204/205
  final reference implementation. The engine's public API changed argument
  order for signature `sign`/`verify` and requires `.js` in subpath imports;
  both are absorbed inside this package's wrappers, so no downstream package
  or caller is affected.
- Description and keywords updated to reflect SLH-DSA / FIPS 205 coverage.

### Verification
- 11 node tests pass, 7 browser-smoke tests pass, 39 pinned vectors pass.
- **Compatibility gate:** every ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-768, HKDF, fingerprint and
  webhook vector pinned under `@noble/post-quantum@0.2.1` still matches
  bit-for-bit under `0.6.1`. Deterministic keys derived from existing KXCO
  master secrets — including Armature L1 identities — are unchanged.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.2] â€” 2026-05-22

Documentation correction. No code changes; no behaviour changes; no
cryptographic surface changes vs `1.1.1`.

### Fixed
- **AUDIT.md** Â§1 previously cited a 2024 Cure53 audit of
  `@noble/post-quantum`. That citation was incorrect â€” Cure53's 2023
  NDS-01 audit covered `@noble/ciphers`, `@noble/curves`, and
  `@noble/hashes` only; the post-quantum package was not in scope. As of
  2026-05-22, upstream `@noble/post-quantum` has only been self-audited
  by its maintainer (v0.6.1, April 2026). AUDIT.md Â§1 has been rewritten
  to reflect the actual upstream audit posture. A correction notice is
  included at the top of the file. Reviewers who relied on the prior
  citation should re-read Â§1 of AUDIT.md.
- **CHANGELOG.md** 1.0.0 entry similarly stated "audited by Cure53,
  2024" alongside the upstream pin. That sentence has been corrected
  in-place in this release; the substance of the 1.0.0 release is
  otherwise unchanged.

### Why this is a patch, not an advisory
The misstatement was in documentation only. No code path, signature,
key-derivation routine, or wire format depends on the cited audit. The
fix is a documentation rewrite; affected installs upgrade by pulling
1.1.2. If your due-diligence pack referenced AUDIT.md from 1.0.1
through 1.1.1, please refresh against 1.1.2.

## [1.1.1] â€” 2026-05-21

Operational hardening release. No source-code changes; this is the first
release published via **npm Trusted Publishing** rather than a long-lived
`NPM_TOKEN`.

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` now publishes via npm Trusted Publishing
  (OIDC). The `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` / `NPM_OTP` env vars are removed; the
  workflow's `id-token: write` permission is the entire credential.
  Registered at https://www.npmjs.com/package/kxco-post-quantum/access
  binding `org=JackKXCO`, `repo=kxco-post-quantum`, `workflow=publish.yml`.
- Repo-level `NPM_TOKEN` and `NPM_OTP` secrets removed â€” no long-lived
  credentials remain in the publishing path.

### Why this matters
- Every release tarball is now signed by GitHub Actions OIDC against the
  exact commit being published, with no human-held secret in the loop.
- No more burning recovery codes per release. The publish workflow now
  runs hands-free on every `v*` tag push.

## [1.1.0] â€” 2026-05-21

Same API. Same byte-for-byte outputs (all 29 pinned vectors still match).
The package now runs in **browsers** as well as Node.

### Added
- Isomorphic runtime â€” every module works identically in modern browsers
  (Chromium, Firefox, Safari) and Node, served from CDNs like esm.sh
  with zero polyfill burden
- `test/browser-smoke.test.js` runs the public API with `globalThis.Buffer`
  removed, asserts plain `Uint8Array` outputs and a clean hybrid-signing
  round trip â€” proves browser compatibility in CI

### Changed
- HKDF-SHA-512 now sourced from `@noble/hashes/hkdf` (was `node:crypto`)
- HMAC-SHA-256 now sourced from `@noble/hashes/hmac` (was `node:crypto`)
- SHA-256 for kid fingerprints now sourced from `@noble/hashes/sha256`
  (was `node:crypto`)
- Constant-time comparisons are portable byte loops (replaces
  `node:crypto.timingSafeEqual`) â€” identical security property,
  runs in browsers
- Functions return `Buffer` on Node (when `globalThis.Buffer` is defined)
  and plain `Uint8Array` in browsers. **Backwards compatible** for Node
  callers; `Buffer extends Uint8Array` so any code accepting `Uint8Array`
  already works.
- `engines.node` bumped to `>=20.19` to match the underlying
  `@noble/hashes@2` requirement (Node 18 is past EOL)

### Dependencies
- Added `@noble/hashes ^2.2.0` (peer of `@noble/post-quantum`)
- `@noble/post-quantum ^0.2.1` unchanged

### Verification
- 9 node tests pass
- 6 browser-smoke tests pass
- 29 pinned vectors still match â€” no cryptographic surface changes,
  bit-for-bit identical to 1.0.3 in Node

## [1.0.3] â€” 2026-05-21

First release ships with SLSA Level 2 provenance attestation tied to a
public GitHub Actions workflow run. No cryptographic surface changes
vs `1.0.2` â€” every diff is metadata, types, CI, and hygiene.

### Added
- SLSA Level 2 provenance on every published release via GitHub Actions OIDC
  (`publishConfig.provenance: true`)
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` triggered by `v*` tags â€” runs tests then
  `npm publish --provenance --access public`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` matrix over Node 18 / 20 / 22 on every push and PR
- Hand-written TypeScript declarations (`.d.ts`) for all six modules; wired
  into `exports[*].types` so TypeScript consumers get full typings without
  any build step
- `.github/dependabot.yml` â€” weekly npm + github-actions ecosystem checks
- `sideEffects: false` for tree-shaking
- `funding` field in `package.json`
- Top-level `"types"` field in `package.json` pointing at `./src/index.d.ts`

### Changed
- `package.json` `files` allowlist tightened to `["src", "README.md", "LICENSE",
  "SECURITY.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]` â€” locks down what ships to npm
- `package.json` `exports` now declares per-subpath `types` + `import` keys
- `SECURITY.md` rewritten in the standard short-form template with explicit
  in-scope / out-of-scope split delegating primitive bugs upstream to
  `@noble/post-quantum`
- All third-party actions in workflows pinned by 40-char commit SHA, never
  floating tags
- README badge row trimmed to four (`npm`, `license`, `Socket`, `production-live`)
  and a 60-second live-verify quickstart added under the title

### Security
- No cryptographic code changed in this release â€” every change is metadata,
  types, CI, and documentation. Production behaviour is bit-for-bit identical
  to `1.0.2`.

## [1.0.2] â€” 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Repository URL on the npm package metadata now points to
  `github.com/JackKXCO/kxco-post-quantum`. No code change.

## [1.0.1] â€” 2026-05-21

### Added
- `AUDIT.md` â€” self-attested audit posture with roadmap (external audit
  Q3 2026, public bug bounty Q4 2026, FIPS 140-3 CMVP application 2027)
- `test/vectors.json` â€” 29 deterministic test vectors pinning every primitive
  output bit-for-bit
- `test/run-vectors.js` â€” runner anyone can use to verify reproducibility
- `npm test` runs both the functional tests and vector verification
- `npm run test:vectors` for vector check only

### Changed
- `SECURITY.md` sharpened with explicit threat model and pinned upstream
  `@noble/post-quantum@0.2.1` integrity hash
- `README.md` "Used in production at" section with file refs to chain.kxco.ai

No API changes from `1.0.0`.

## [1.0.0] â€” 2026-05-21

First stable release. Committed public API surface:

- `mlDsa.keypairFromMaster(master, info—)`, `mlDsa.sign`, `mlDsa.verify`
- `mlKem.keypairFromMaster(master, info—)`, `mlKem.encapsulate`, `mlKem.decapsulate`
- `deriveSeed(master, info, length)`
- `fingerprint(publicKey)`, `kidEquals(a, b)`
- `webhook.envelope`, `webhook.hmacHex`, `webhook.verifyHmac`,
  `webhook.pqSign`, `webhook.verifyPq`, `webhook.signDelivery`,
  `webhook.verifyDelivery`

Verified at release: 9/9 functional tests + 29/29 vector checks pass.

Underlying primitives via `@noble/post-quantum@^0.2.1`. See `AUDIT.md` for
upstream audit posture (no third-party audit of the PQ package; self-audited
by maintainer at v0.6.1, April 2026). ESM-only. Node.js 18+.
